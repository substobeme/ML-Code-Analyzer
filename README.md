# ML-Code-Checker-with-CoTs
The goal of this project is to use prompt engineering to create a ml code checker using existing models. I an using hugging face free models as well as state of the art models to do the task. For a code i am using
an example code, in that I will generate multiple chains of thoughts and calcultate self consistency amongst them. Naturally the chain with the highest consistency is the best.
